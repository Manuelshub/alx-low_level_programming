# 0x17-doubly_linked_lists

## Description

This project contains solutions and implementations for tasks related to doubly linked lists in the C programming language. Each task involves various operations on doubly linked lists, such as insertion, deletion, and manipulation.

## Files

Here is a list of the files in the project along with a brief description of each:

- **0-print_dlistint.c**: A function that prints all the elements of a doubly linked list.
- **1-dlistint_len.c**: A function that returns the number of elements in a doubly linked list.
- **2-add_dnodeint.c**: A function that adds a new node at the beginning of a doubly linked list.
- **3-add_dnodeint_end.c**: A function that adds a new node at the end of a doubly linked list.
- **4-free_dlistint.c**: A function that frees a doubly linked list.
- **5-get_dnodeint.c**: A function that returns the nth node of a doubly linked list.
- **6-sum_dlistint.c**: A function that returns the sum of all the data (n) of a doubly linked list.
- **7-insert_dnodeint.c**: A function that inserts a new node at a given position in a doubly linked list.
- **8-delete_dnodeint.c**: A function that deletes a node at a given position in a doubly linked list.

## Compilation

To compile the C files, use the following command:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o your_executable_name
