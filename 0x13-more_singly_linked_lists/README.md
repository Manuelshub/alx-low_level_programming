# More Singly Linked List

This Directory contains files for the ALX More singly linked lists project.

## Introduction

A singly linked list is a data structure that contains a sequence of elements, where each element points to the next element in the sequence. This project provides a simple implementation of a singly linked list, including insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal operations.

## Features

- Creation of singly linked lists.
- Insertion of nodes at the beginning, end, or at specific positions.
- Deletion of nodes by value.
- Searching for nodes by value.
- Traversal of the list to access or modify elements.
