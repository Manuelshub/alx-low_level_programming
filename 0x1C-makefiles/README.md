# 0x1C-makefiles

This project contains a collection of C programs and corresponding Makefiles for learning and practicing the basics of using makefiles in C development.

## Description

The repository includes several C source files along with their respective header files and Makefiles. Each program demonstrates various concepts related to makefiles, such as:

- Compiling multiple source files
- Specifying compiler flags
- Using variables in Makefiles
- Writing clean and efficient Makefile rules
- Understanding dependencies and target rules
- Building and managing large-scale projects

## Requirements

To run the programs in this repository, you need:

- A Unix-based operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS)
- GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed
- Make utility installed

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Manuelshub/alx-low_level_programming/0x1C-makefiles.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd 0x1C-makefiles
    ```

3. Choose the program you want to compile and run.

4. Run the following command to compile the program using the respective Makefile:

    ```bash
    make
    ```

5. Execute the compiled program:

    ```bash
    ./program_name
    ```

## Files and Directory Structure

- `Makefile`: Contains rules and instructions for compiling the programs.
- `*.c`: C source files containing the implementation of various programs.
- `*.h`: Header files containing function prototypes and declarations.
